## Hi there 👋 
I’m **Mehmet Emre YILDIZ** — a **Full-Stack Developer** based in Vienna 🇦🇹  
🎓 Currently enrolled in the **Mastery Program at 42 Vienna**  
🔧 With a strong foundation in **C** and **C++** from the 42 Common Core, I’m expanding my expertise into **full-stack web** and **mobile development**.

#### 🏗️ Programs I Built at 42

During my journey at **42 Vienna**, I completed the following projects: !Most of my repositories are private as a security concerns 

- **Libft** – Custom C library implementing common functions to strengthen C fundamentals.  
- **ft_printf** – Custom implementation of printf, enhancing understanding of variadic functions and formatting.  
- **Get_Next_Line** – Function to read lines from a file descriptor, practicing memory management.  
- **Push_Swap** – Sorting algorithm project using stacks with minimal operations.  
- **so_long** – 2D game using C and MiniLibX with collectibles and map validation.
